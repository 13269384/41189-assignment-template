    "The problem that is being investigated and researched through these models is the effects of the coronavirus in the housing market. Coronavirus is an infectious disease/ virus spread through the transmission of droplets e.g. exhale, sneeze, cough as these droplets hang in the air. As the world is currently living in a global pandemic this has created uncertainty and unpredictable outcomes for both consumers and business’. This has ultimately affected the way that society, markets, business’ and the world operate to accommodate this change. Previously, the Australian housing market has seen significant growth fueled by the demand of consumers as well as infrastructure investment from the government. However Coronavirus has resulted in significant effects of a recession creating falling consumer confidence with reduced demand for properties as workers are losing jobs and earning less money. This makes it much harder to borrow money from banks due to instability in jobs, with the housing market having to discount and lower prices for properties to make sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a group the effects of the coronavirus in the housing market create both short and long term effects. Some student’s families do not have steady incomes and have resulted in dependence on centrelink and job seeker/ keeper. This can create increased short term distress and potential family issues, while potentially elevating later issues related to mental health. Due to the struggle to pay for basic necessities like the rent of their own home. The unpredictability of this situation can create different reactions from individuals depending on their personal circumstances. University students have also found it harder to find part time jobs as the workforce is shrinking and for those graduating this has made it even harder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore in the long-term as students start to buy a house or apartment this is an important investment which could benefit from this pandemic. This is because the housing market is unlikely to quickly bounce back and recover from this significant obstacle. Instead housing prices are expected to be lower for the next period of time making it cheaper and easier for this generation to buy or rent a house assuming they have a steady job and income. \n",
    "The importance and relevance of coronavirus to society has already created significant short term effects impacting people’s day to day lives. Lowered consumer confidence and increasing levels of unemployment has created detrimental effects to the economy meaning people cannot live their lives normally. This has resulted in individuals and families having to find alternative homes when they can no longer afford rent, such as downgrading or even government housing. These changes in society have a multiplier effect from business’ all the way down to individuals, which can directly or indirectly create negative impacts. There isn’t a single individual that is not affected by these impacts and they have created challenges for day to day life and for the future. "
