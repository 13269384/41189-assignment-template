    "The problem that is being investigated and researched through these models is the effects of the coronavirus in the housing market. Coronavirus is an infectious disease/ virus spread through the transmission of droplets e.g. exhale, sneeze, cough as these droplets hang in the air. As the world is currently living in a global pandemic this has created uncertainty and unpredictable outcomes for both consumers and business’. This has ultimately affected the way that society, markets, business’ and the world operate to accommodate this change. Previously, the Australian housing market has seen significant growth fueled by the demand of consumers as well as infrastructure investment from the government. However Coronavirus has resulted in significant effects of a recession creating falling consumer confidence with reduced demand for properties as workers are losing jobs and earning less money. This makes it much harder to borrow money from banks due to instability in jobs, with the housing market having to discount and lower prices for properties to make sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a group, the effects of the coronavirus in the housing market creates both short and long term effects. Some student’s families do not have steady incomes and have resulted in dependence on centrelink and job seeker/ keeper. This can create increased short term distress and potential family issues, while potentially elevating later issues related to mental health. Due to the struggle to pay for basic necessities like the rent of their own home. The unpredictability of this situation can create different reactions from individuals depending on their personal circumstances. University students have also found it harder to find part time jobs as the workforce is shrinking and for those graduating this has made it even harder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore in the long-term as students start to buy a house or apartment this is an important investment which could benefit from this pandemic. This is because the housing market is unlikely to quickly bounce back and recover from this significant obstacle. Instead housing prices are expected to be lower for the next period of time making it cheaper and easier for this generation to buy or rent a house assuming they have a steady job and income. \n",
    "The importance and relevance of coronavirus to society has already created significant short term effects impacting people’s day to day lives. Lowered consumer confidence and increasing levels of unemployment has created detrimental effects to the economy meaning people cannot live their lives normally. This has resulted in individuals and families having to find alternative homes when they can no longer afford rent, such as downgrading or even government housing. These changes in society have a multiplier effect from business’ all the way down to individuals, which can directly or indirectly create negative impacts. There isn’t a single individual that is not affected by these impacts and they have created challenges for day to day life and for the future. \n"

    "The government quickly responded to this sudden change when coronavirus was first reported in March. The Reserve Bank of Australia reacted by immediately decreasing the cash rate to a record low of 0.25% on March 19. This was an important response to accommodate the reaction of the economy following the difficulty in affordability of houses. Thus, making it cheaper to borrow money from the banks in hopes of stimulating and improving the economy. This can be seen in the graph below of the cash target rate by the RBA, and its reduction in response to current economic conditions. "

This \\\\$17.6 billion stimulus package has three main aims: protecting Australian health, securing jobs and livelihood and being able to bounce back when this crisis is over. A further \\\\$750 cash payments to approximately 6.5 million people on low incomes costing \\\\$4.67 billion was implemented for economic stimulus to those in welfare or pensions. As this was only a quarter of stimulus, the remaining is for businesses to receive cash payments and wage subsidies for apprentices to help during this period of time. \n",

    "Businesses have had to respond to partial closures during peak coronavirus periods in lockdown, creating loss of profit and clientele. As a result this has had a multiplier effect resulting in reducing staff, reducing supplies and restricting the amount of people in their shop. There is only so much that can be done by these businesses to help their staff and shop from going under with uncertainty about when it will recover. Some businesses have seen opposite effects with a particular spike in alcohol and homeware purchases. Within the housing market strict closure of open homes and auctions were put to a hold during the lockdown, making it much harder to direct sales and achieve a strong market. Recently, restricted numbers in open houses are allowed with preference for personal bookings to reduce the spread. Similarly auctions are more likely to be held in auction rooms rather than on the actual property and pre-negotiated deals are usually preferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all this help and stimulus, this creates opportunity within the market to eventually recover and bounce back. As the cost of borrowing is historically low at record low interest rates and the economy has not fully shut down. This means that there is potential and opportunity for recovery for the economy but how long this will take is uncertain. "

Coronavirus in the housing market affects many different involved parties which create different stakeholders. The government wants more people to buy houses as this means that individuals are paying stamp duty and taxes, creating a form of revenue. This revenue can be further injected into funding more infrastructure investment to build apartments and houses to create a cycle of revenue. Consumers are the ones that want to buy these different properties as it means they have a place to live and start their life. They are looking for the most valuable property to accommodate their individual needs which further benefits the economy through their consumption. All real estate business’ aim to sell a large number of properties at high prices as they are paid by commission and are seeking to receive a high profit. \n",

    "This rich picture creates a very visual interpretation of both the system and stakeholders capturing the essential elements. The main stakeholders are consumers, government and business’ as they play a vital role within the housing market that is now affected by the coronavirus. Essentially businesses provide a good or service which means they have to rent or buy a property to carry out these activities. They need to employ workers to be able to complete these tasks and they are then paid a wage. With this wage, workers and consumers need to have a place to stay e.g. a house or apartment which can be bought or rented. With the money they make, part of this will go to a real estate business to purchase a property as well as to the government through stamp duty and taxes. Similarly the real estate business will have to pay taxes e.g. company tax as well. This revenue generated from the interaction between business’ and consumers benefits the business as well as all parties involved. "

    "Models have been the forefront of many key policy decisions relating to COVID-19, largely due to the unforeseeable nature of the virus and many uncertainties about the spread. Models are important tools for shaping health systems during the pandemic, estimating epidemiological knowledge of the virus and its spread as well as determining the best path forward (Buckman et al., 2020). The virus has affected travel, retail, manufacturing, finance, technology and notably the housing industry. A study of how the current models are being addressed and how it has affected the Australian housing market will be discussed. The housing market is one of the major industries that drive the Australian economy through investment and construction. Across the globe, countries are struggling with COVID-19 both as a public health crisis and economic recession."

At the time the WHO created a Global risk assessment framework during the inter-epidemic period to conduct the most appropriate strategy based on the country’s level of risk. In the risk assessment strategy, there are five outlined phases where the level of risk is incremental as the cases escalate (World Health Organization, 2004). This framework also includes WHO alerting the international community of the virus outbreak and its spread and that countries who have any cases must report to WHO within 24 hours of the receipt of positive test results."

    "b) The Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) framework, acts similar to the way the SARS-CoV-2 spreads and is currently used to predict future transmission scenarios. The SEIR model indicates that individuals may flow in-between stages from Susceptible and infected individual come into contact, exposed indicates that there is a delay between exposure and infection, then the number of infectious individuals who are capable of spreading the virus and lastly in this stage these are individuals who have either been recovered, died or are resistant from the virus. Due to the four phases of the SEIR framework, it is classified as a compartmental model as each individual typically progresses from one phase to another in order. This type of model is also a mechanistic model, which assumes that a complex system can be understood by examining its individual parts and in the order, they work and is one of the only ways to analyse possible long term epidemiological outcomes (Holmdahl & Buckee, 2020). Models are a way for researchers to establish what is known about viral transmissions and to design improved systems that produce more dynamic results rather than human intuition alone. Hospitalisation and deaths have become reliable data, however, many biological features are still hard to depict and remain unknown (Holmdahl & Buckee, 2020). "

These models focus on the importance of implementing social distancing measures to slow the spread of transmission. It is important for banks, investors and homeowners to have access to accurate house price predictions data. With the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms researchers are able to forecast house prices and predictions in Australia and compare it to traditional models. The Macquarie Business School as deployed 47 algorithms to generate predictions then it will use statistical tests to evaluate each forecast and find any variances. "

However, the Chinese government acted swiftly and three weeks into the epidemic a lockdown with travel restrictions was applied. Shortly after, Quarantine was enforced to the rest of the cities which affected more than 50 million people. Although the virus outbreak is first to appear in China, it is also one of the first to contain it. According to the study conducted by Wang et al.

According to the Australia Bureau of Statistics, residential property sales fell drastically in all of Australia’s capital cities during the June 2020 quarter with a weighted average of -1.8%; Sydney falling -2.2% behind. Residential property prices are important to policymakers, market analysts and researchers as it is used to study how the spread COVID-19 has affected the Australian housing market.

    "c) There are many challenges with forecasting house prices, the main issue being that there is a minimum length of available data as the virus only started to affect the Australian house market this year. Another challenge is that house price ratios are formulated in a monthly and quarterly fashion which makes it difficult to build and test  ML models. It was found by the Macquarie Business School that the best forecasting models are from a small scale model rather than the random walk model because there is room for cross-evaluation. Because the data set collected on Australia house prices are all new, released on a monthly frequency and the change in individuals income levels depending on the virus spread rate, it makes it difficult to construct algorithms to predict accurate prices for the future."

    "d) According to the ICCT report, it suggests that during the period of late February to late April there was a noticeable response to COVID-19 by the far-right group, most of their framework has been an act on authority, activism and pro-social behaviour using propaganda (McNeil-Willson, 2020). It has been suggested that this group has been exploiting the pandemic as a way to enforce propaganda and activism, for instance, such propaganda has been used to spread misinformation and to aid recruitment and induce violence. Thus, why there is a strong need to identify the influential crisis frames of far-right politics in order to develop community resilience (McNeil-Willson, 2020). Not only does framing help to understand symbols and models used by groups but it also helps in the evaluation and functionality of the frames itself. Whilst framing is important for identifying Far-right responses to the COVID crisis, it is also wise to consider how these frames and models behave in a wider political and economical context (Coibion et al., 2020).

Clearly, there is huge uncertainty when it comes to making decisions as there are a large range of factors that contribute to making a choice. Unfortunately during these unprecedented times, the ability for people to ascertain a concrete outcome is extremely difficult. The fear of another uncontrollable outbreak occurring in Australia has made many people wary of committing to decisions as they are unsure if what they based their decision on will be valid in the future. The major factor of uncertainty about the future is contributing to people’s fear and worries as they may feel like there are no answers. It is due to these limiting factors of uncertainty in one outcome that decision tree models will be extremely useful. By providing a way to model a wide variety of influencing factors, decision trees offer aid in decision making as they demonstrate possible consequences and include the probability of that event occurring. It is because of these qualities of a decision tree model that they will be extremely useful in assisting people to predict whether selling their property will benefit them or not. Furthermore, by considering the circumstances this information can help predict the impact on covid-19 on the housing market. Ultimately, the decision tree will be used to predict the outcome of people selling or not selling their properties due to factors related Covid-19."

In a time of doubt, accepting what is happening in people’s lives, jobs and the economy, in particular the impact towards the housing market is important, as it is the one of the major sources of prosperity for most Australian families (Brugler, 2020). The pandemic has produced one of the quickest and greatest global economic shortenings towards the property market. As house values generally take longer to change or have an effect based on the different reasons caused by the economy. Fundamentally, houses are harder to buy and sell than stocks and bonds, as individuals view houses as more than just an investment. By using the random walk model, it would create an effective market theory, which can indicate the previous house prices and reflect the impact of the outbreak with current available information, based on the facts provided any changes in the cost should be at random (Yardney, 2020)."

    "From the multiple factors influencing the housing market price due to the pandemic, decisions on whether to buy or sell during this timeframe is uncertain for most Australian individuals and families. The notion that people wanting to buy property during this time is to purchase at the lowest rate and price, whereas those that want to sell are to gain as much profit as possible. When creating a random walk model, the data gathered from research should consist of the interest rate, demand based on location and income prior to COVID-19 as well the current data collected during this period (Saunders & Tulip, 2019).

    "To develop a random walk model, start with a random number of either -1 or 1. After this step, randomly select any of the digits then increase the amount to the observation from the previous time step and repeat the steps for as long as needed. This process can be described by y(t) = B0 + B1*X(t-1) + e(t), where y(t) is the following value in the sequence. B0 is a coefficient that if set to a value other than zero adds a constant drift to the random walk. B1 is a factor to weight the previous time step and is set to 1.0. X(t-1) is the remark at the previous time step. e(t) is the white noise or random variation at that time (Brownlee, 2020)."

The web consists of pages and the pages can be connected to one another via links.
